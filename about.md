### Bio

Kai-Ray is a data manipulator, investigator and problem solver.  He is curious to the many intersections data has within this modern world.  With over 6 years (and counting) of analytics experience in advertising and technology and 1 data science bootcamp under his belt, he is a well-traveled analyst looking for the next interesting dataset to work on.  His primary toolkit includes Python (and its many stats, machine learning and data viz libraries), SQL and good ole' Excel but he's always on the look out for something better and faster.  Those who have seen him in the wild say he is friendly, proactive and a good team player.  Those who know him private say he is a deep thinker and a deep sleeper.
